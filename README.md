# React Fretboard Component

A reusable React component designed to generate fretboards for stringed instruments with any number of strings, frets, or tuning types. Integrated with **Tonal.js** to visualize scales, arpeggios, triads, and chords.

## Completed Milestones

- Customizable fretboard for any number of frets and strings.
- Realistic fret spacing.
- Visual representation of notes on each fret.
- Chromatic array of notes for each string based on fret count, with options to display flats or sharps.
- Integration with Tonal.js to display scales.

## Upcoming Milestones

- Option for double-string courses, simulating instruments like the Cuban tres or 12-string guitar.
- Tonal.js integration for arpeggios, triads, and chords (currently limited to scales).
- Implementation of tests.
- Preparation for npm package distribution.
